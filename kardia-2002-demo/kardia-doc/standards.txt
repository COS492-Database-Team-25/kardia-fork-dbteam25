1.  Naming Prefixes
===================
Each module for Kardia has its own four-letter abbreviation used throughout
the application to provide clarity and prevent namespace colisions.  Listed
below are the currently defined prefixes.  If you add a new module, please
place its four-letter abbreviation in alphabetical order below.

   acct - Accounting
   ptnr - Partner
   smgr - (*) System Manager
   
(*) Note that the System Manager prefix is used for system information.
This is not necessarily a part of the system manager module, but rather it
denotes that the information provided is for the system, not necessarily
part of the current module.  This prefix can be used anywhere to provide
clarity.


2.  Coding Standards
====================

2.1.  Code Formatting
=====================
All Kardia code (including .sql scripts, shell scripts, Centrallix app
files, etc) will be indented using only the TAB character.  We recommend
setting the tab-stop to 4 to allow easy reading of the code.  The reason we
chose to use only the TAB character (and not mixed tab/spaces, or only
spaces) is because the tab width can be configured to each individual
preference based on the editor (see recommended .vimrc below)

   Recommended .vimrc
   ------------------
   set ts=4
   set noeexpandtab
   set autoindent

When creating code, the first rule of thumb is to never mix coding styles.  
If you are in a file that uses a different style than everything else,
please conform to that style.  See the following code segment for an
indication of the recommended coding style (NOTE: replace beginning spaces
with tabs):

   #include <stdio.h>
   int main() {
       int i, number=1;
       char buf[256];

       for (i=0; i < 10; i++) {
           sprintf(buf, "%sHello world! (%d)\n", buf, number);
           number = (i + number) * (i*i);
       }
       printf("%s", buf);
   }

	
2.2.  Documentation Formatting
==============================
When creating documentation for Kardia, please use plain text files with a
.txt entension.  Naming for document files should be all lower case with the
underscore character replacing spaces.  All paragraphs should be wrapped at
76 characters (in vim, type "tw=76" to set auto textwrapping).  NEVER use
tabs in documentation to format the text.  Documentation should always have
spaces for white-space, and never tabs.

If you are creating an image for the documentation, please convert it to the
PNG format before committing it to the CVS repository.  The same naming
conventions apply to image filenames as documents.
