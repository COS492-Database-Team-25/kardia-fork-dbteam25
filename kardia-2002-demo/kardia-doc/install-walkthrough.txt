Centrallix/Sybase/Kardia installation walkthrough
by Jonathan Rupp
==================================================

First off, let me say that I am not expert (nor even that good) at
installing, administering, or securing Sybase, this guide is just to let you
reproduce the demo that we (the Centrallix/Kardia developers) presented June
4, 2002 at ICCM at Taylor University.  Also, this is a direct walkthrough of
the installation on my new Redhat 7.3 install, and it is not guaranteed to
work on your machine, no matter the distro, etc.

First, let's get all the downloads out of the way first:

Sybase: http://crm.sybase.com/sybase/www/ESD/ase_linux_download.jsp (you'll
        have to fill out a form to get to the downloads page, I'm using
        11.0.3.3-6 for this example which was not the newest one offered when 
        I wrote this -- 11.9.x is NOT free for deployment, only for development)
        I used the following:
            sybase-ase-11_0_3_3-6_i386.rpm (db engine)
            sybase-doc-11_0_3_3-6_i386.rpm (documentation)
            sybase-ocsd-10_0_4-6_i386.rpm (development library)

Centrallix: (the following will create the 5 centrallix directories at the
        location where you type them.)
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.centrallix.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/centrallix login
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.centrallix.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/centrallix co centrallix
        (required -- server core)
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.centrallix.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/centrallix co centrallix-lib
        (required -- server core libraries)
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.centrallix.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/centrallix co centrallix-os
        (required -- server configuration, objectsystem root)
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.centrallix.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/centrallix co centrallix-doc
        (optional -- application (ie. Kardia) developer documentation)
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.centrallix.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/centrallix co centrallix-sysdoc
        (optional -- Centrallix developer documentation)

Kardia: (once again, the 3 kardia directories will be created at the
        location you run these commands):
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.kardia.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/kardia login
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.kardia.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/kardia co kardia-db
        (required -- database creation scripts)
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.kardia.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/kardia co kardia-app
        (required -- app files)
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.kardia.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/kardia co kardia-doc
        (optional -- documentation)

become root for the following steps:
    Install the Sybase RPMS:
       rpm -ivh sybase-*

    Run the installation script (may be different path)
        /opt/sybase/install/sybinstall.sh
        Accept the license
        create group sybase
        create user sybase
        set password for sybase user

    Become the sybase user
        su - sybase
        start srvbuild

        ctrl-x Exit Screen
        ctrl-x Exit Screen

    Copy init script for sybase
        cp /opt/sybase/install/rc.sybase /etc/init.d/sybase
            (note: the database is started automatically after
            configutation, this script is to start and stop it other times)

you can return your normal user for the rest of this install.
    Login to sybase as sa (System Administrator)
            (note: if you're like me and have unixODBC installed, you have an
            isql binary in /usr/bin, so you need to specify the full path to the
            sybase isql binary in /opt/sybase/bin'
        /opt/sybase/bin/isql -Usa

    Change system administrator password
        sp_password null,newpass
        go

    Create kardia database (need a bit more than the default storage size)
        create database kardia on default = 10
        go

    Create login for yourself (this needs to match your centrallix username/password)
        sp_addlogin username,password
        go

    Switch to the kardia database
        use kardia
        go

    Alias the newly created user to dbo (in kardia)
        sp_addalias jorupp,dbo
        go
            (note: this is a really big security problem, but it works -- I
            said I'm not a DBA....)

    Set the kardia database to be the default for your user
        sp_modifylogin username,defdb,kardia
        go

    Exit isql
        quit

    Build centrallix-lib
        cd centrallix-lib
        make depend (note: XFree86-devel required for makedepend)
        make

    Build centrallix
        cd ../centrallix
        make depend (note: XFree86-devel required for makedepend)
        echo 1 > .subbuild
        make    (if your system fails the build with a message about
                readline, remove -lreadline and -lncurses at line 121 in 
                Makefile, and rerun make -- If I remember correctly, this
                happens with some version of Redhat and others)
        make modules
                (if you get a message about not finding ctpublic.h, you
                don't have the OpenServer-Client Development library
                installed)

    Install and configure Centrallix
        As root: (from centrallix directory)
            make modules_install 
            mkdir /usr/local/bin/centrallix
            cp centrallix /usr/local/bin/centrallix
            cp ../centrallix-os/doc/install/centrallix.conf /usr/local/etc/
            cp ../centrallix-os/doc/install/types.cfg /usr/local/etc/
            cp ../centrallix-os/doc/install/rootnode /usr/local/etc/
            cd /usr/local/etc
            chown user:group centrallix.conf types.cfg rootnode (make it
            owned by yourself)
        As your normal user: (from /usr/local/etc)
            Modify centrallix.conf as follows:
                Set the net_http listen_port to something higher than 1024
                (so you don't have to run as root)
                Under mtsession, set auth_method = "altpasswd" and enable
                the altpasswd_file (the default /usr/local/etc/cxpasswd)
            Create your cxpasswd file
                htpasswd -cd cxpasswd username
                    if you don't have apache (and hence htpasswd), you can
                    still make this, it needs to be a file with one line, of
                    the format username:crypted_passwd (man 3 crypt)
            Modify rootnode
                change path to point to where you put centrallix-os at
                    ie. path="/home/jorupp/work/centrallix-os"
    
    Install and configure Kardia (from the directory with kardia-app/db/doc)
        cd kardia-db
        export SYBASE="/opt/sybase/"
        make clean
        make
    Create a symlink from your centrallix-os directory to kardia-app
        ln -s /home/jorupp/work/kardia-app /home/jorupp/work/centrallix-os/kardia
            (note: the symlink must be named kardia, as that is hardcoded in
            the app file right now)


    Launch Centrallix
        /usr/local/bin/centrallix/centrallix
            You should see "mod: osdriver sybd"...

    Launch Netscape 4.7x and test away!
        start with http://host:port/kardia/kardia.app
        if you get a system/void -- you've got a directory, request a file
        if you get scrollbars on the right or bottom, you need to make your
            window bigger
        if nothing happens (you can't click things, etc.), try
            /kardia/kardia-simple.app -- it doesn't use as many new features
        if nothing still happens, try /samples/form.app -- it uses very
            few new features
