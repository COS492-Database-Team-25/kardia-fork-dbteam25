Overview of the project:
This project is meant to be able to give missionaries using Kardia updates on what is happening with their donors. 
For example, if a donor hasn't given in a few months for no reason, we want the missionary to know, so we have this.
The main file is the update_descriptives_new.qy file, found in kardia-app/modules/rcpt
It first clears out old descriptives
It then makes a working copy of the data
Then it generates all the descriptives
You can see a description of the a_descriptives_hist table on this website https://www.codn.net/projects/kardia/wiki/index.php/Kardia:NewTables_a_descriptives_hist
Then the merges execute
It first merges catchups, then adjacent giving segments, then catchup gifts that have extras as well, then extras, then adjacent giving segments again, then adjacent single gifts, then adjacent giving segments twice, then approximate values for everything that doesn't fit in
It then corrects issues with the prev_end and next_start fields that arose due to the merges
Then it corrects the Next to Last tracking issues
Then it adjusts the calculations for the averages
It then updates whether or not the donation is current, lapsing, or already lapsed
It then calculates increases and decreases in giving
Then it returns the data to the user


Uses of the Analytics:
Right now the primary uses of the analytics are on end-of-year donor reports and when using Kardia's advanced search feature.

In the advanced search feature, there is a mix of overall descriptives (a_descriptives table) and giving history descriptives (a_descriptives_hist table) used when filtering by analytics data.

Here is a summary of where each type of descriptive is used:
Summary of analytics that use table a_descriptives partially or wholy:
- min and max total giving
- min and max average monthly giving
- min and max total gift count
- status
- changes: last gift (gift has to be lapsed)
Summary of analytics that use table a_descriptives_hist partially or wholy:
- searching requires a hist entry to, at minimum, overlap start and end dates when they are provided
- min and max gift amount
- min and max giving interval
- changes: all

When using advanced search, a date range can be specified to limit which giving histories are looked at. If one field is left blank, then the range effectively extends to the earliest/latest gift in the giving histories. If both fields are left blank, no limiting by dates is performed.
In general, a giving history's timespan is only required to overlap to match a date range. However, when looking for when a change in giving occurs, the date of the change is required to be within the provided start and end dates.
