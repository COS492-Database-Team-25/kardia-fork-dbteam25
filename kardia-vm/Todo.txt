TODO Before Final Release of Kardia VM 1.0:

1.  Delete host keys before generating VM, to make sure they are regenerated
    uniquely for each time the VM is installed.  This prevents us having a
    bunch of VM's out there with identical host keys.  That would be bad if
    someone puts a VM live up on the internet.

2.  When deleting directories, make sure we cd out of them and then back into
    newly created ones (e.g., when re-initializing a repository).

3.  When pushing individual to shared, or pulling shared to individual, in
    Team mode, config the origin URL temporarily and then swap it back.  This
    allows the user to config a different URL for using an external IDE.
