TODO Before Final Release of Kardia VM 1.0:

3.  More sample data in Kardia!


CHANGES FOR RC1 Release of Kardia VM 1.0:

1.  Main menu "Update" option that does a git pull, rebuilds Centrallix and
    the Kardia database, reloads the sample data, updates kardia.sh with the
    new version from the kardia-git/kardia-vm directory, and runs any
    version upgrade scripts (to be added).

2.  Passwords - on password change by user, the cxpasswd and mysql passwords
    are now updated (solved via pam-script).


CHANGES FOR Beta 3 Release of Kardia VM 1.0:

1.  Delete host keys before generating VM, to make sure they are regenerated
    uniquely for each time the VM is installed.  This prevents us having a
    bunch of VM's out there with identical host keys.  That would be bad if
    someone puts a VM live up on the internet.

2.  When pushing individual to shared, or pulling shared to individual, in
    Team mode, config the origin URL temporarily and then swap it back.  This
    allows the user to config a different URL for using an external IDE.

3.  Timezone configuration?  Otherwise time is incorrect!

4.  Setup Guide needs to have Back buttons.  Otherwise the user can get stuck
    during install having not fully completed a step (such as adding users).

5.  Passwords - passwords are not propogated when password is changed by
    root.

6.  Passwords - disable password change by user, pending solution to user
    password change issue for VM 1.0 Final.
