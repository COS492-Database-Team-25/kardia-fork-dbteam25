Kardia is designed to help meet the software needs of non-profit organizations
in the realm of management and finance, built entirely upon open standards and
open software. 

This is a VM image you can run in VMware/VirtualBox/Xen/HyperV.  Targeted at
developers and those who want to try Kardia and Centrallix, it makes
installation & setup simple.  It is based on an up-to-date CentOS 5.6 install
and features a menu-based interface for setup and use.

The VM uses Git to download the latest Kardia and Centrallix source code, and
provides multiple workflow and development options.  The Git repositories are
shared via Samba, so an external IDE can be used to develop, as well.  Or, you
can just as easily use the VM to simply try out Kardia.

At the time of writing, the current Git version of Kardia is not yet complete.
This means that you'll find some things broken or missing.  We're working on
it!  (we do have a live Kardia deployment at one of our clients)

The VM's default password is in the PDF documentation.
