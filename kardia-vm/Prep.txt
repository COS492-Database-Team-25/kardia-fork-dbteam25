Here's a list of things I did to prep the VM Image:

    Removed some packages: kernel-devel redhat-lsb cups poppler poppler-utils mesa-libGL
    Installed: samba mysql-devel
    Added public key for EPEL
    Installed: epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm (this is for the git packages)
    Installed: git gitk git-gui dialog
    Edited: /root/.vimrc to add centrallix-friendly formatting options to it
    Edited: /root/.bashrc to add vi alias to /usr/bin/vim
    Copied: /root/anaconda-ks.cfg to /root/kickstart.cfg
    Edited: /root/kickstart.cfg to reflect added/removed pkgs
    Edited: /etc/pam.d/system-auth to add smbpasswd sync. This is tricky on RHEL5/CentOS5 boxen - it is not clear how to add pam_smbpass.so. The resulting edited file is lower down on this page.
    Edited: /etc/samba/smb.conf to set node and workgroup names / descriptions, set load printers to 'no', added kardia and centrallix shares.
    Created: /etc/samba/smb.conf.noshares, smb.conf.onerepo, smb.conf.userrepo, for the two different repository sharing modes
    Ran 'lokkit' and set firewall to allow SSH, Samba, and 800:tcp
    Change /etc/sysconfig/network 'HOSTNAME' to kardiadevel
    Edited sudoers (visudo) to allow group kardia_root to sudo.
    Edited /etc/ssh/sshd_config to allow only group kardia_ssh ("AllowGroups kardia_ssh")
    Install Ghostscript -- needed to run PDF reports.
    Install libpng-devel -- needed to run reports with images.
    Disable prelink (to avoid using more disk space than needed during the prelinking process)

The Kickstart file reflects some of the above package choices.  However, redhat-lsb and kernel-devel still had to be removed manually.

Before zipping up the hard disk image, it is useful to fill the hard disk
image up with a very large "zero file".  This overwrites residual deleted
data with something highly compressible, allowing the .zip file of the VM to
be significantly smaller:

    dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/zerofile bs=10240
    sync
    rm /tmp/zerofile
    sync
