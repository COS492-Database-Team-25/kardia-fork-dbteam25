    // Note: the reason we often query for json subobjects and then qualify
    // that query in the WHERE clause (i.e., :rec:name == 'recurring') is
    // to avoid 'object does not exist' errors; doing it as a collection
    // join avoids that whereas an element join would throw the error when
    // the element does not exist or is NULL.  JSON just has no way of
    // differentiating between a NULL property and a NULL object.
